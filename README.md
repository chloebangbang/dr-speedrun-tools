The tools I've made for speedrunning Deltarune.

## Sticky Keys Toggle
[docs](stickykeys_toggle/README.md)

Toggles Windows Stick Keys on and off when you run the program. Good for ARSS with shift and ctrl, or if you just hate pressing shift five times.

## Ralsei Quiz Tracker
[docs](ralsei-quiz-tracker/README.md)

For implementing statistics and analysis from Ralsei on Chapter 3's hell board into an OBS scene
