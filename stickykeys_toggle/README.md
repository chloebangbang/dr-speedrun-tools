# Sticky Keys Toggle
---
Does what it says on the tin. You run the program and it toggles sticky keys with a sound effect.
You need some other way to run the program on the desired key press. I use my keyboard's drivers.

This program also writes whether sticky keys was turned on or off to `%tmp%\chloebangbang\sticky.txt` if you want this on an OBS layout or something

This obviously only works on Windows
